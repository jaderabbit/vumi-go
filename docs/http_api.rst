Vumi Go's HTTP API
==================

The API allows for sending & receiving Vumi messages via HTTP. These
messages are plain JSON strings. Two types of messages are available,
TransportUserMessages and TransportEvents. These messages can be received
via streaming HTTP or can be pushed to 3rd party URL via HTTP POST.
Outbound messages & metrics can be pushed to Vumi Go via HTTP PUT.

Each HTTP api is bound to a conversation which stores all of the messages
sent & received. HTTP Basic auth is used for authentication, the username
is the Vumi Go account key and the password is an access token that is
stored in the conversation. In order to connect three keys are required:

1. The account key
2. The access token
3. The conversation key


Vumi Messages
-------------

Vumi messages are JSON objects of the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "message_id": "59b37288d8d94e42ab804158bdbf53e5",
        "in_reply_to": null,
        "session_event": null,
        "to_addr": "1234",
        "from_addr": "27761234567",
        "content": "This is an incoming SMS!",
        "transport_name": "smpp_transport",
        "transport_type": "sms",
        "transport_metadata": {
            // this is a dictionary containing
            // transport specific data
        },
        "helper_metadata": {
            // this is a dictionary containing
            // application specific data
        }
    }

This is the base message format for messages sent & received. A reply to
this message would put the value of the "message_id" in the "in_reply_to"
field so as to link the two.

The "session_event" field is used for transports that are session oriented,
primarily USSD. This field will be either "null", "new", "resume" or "close".
There are no guarantees that these will be set for USSD as it depends on
the networks whether or not these values are available. If replying to a
message in USSD session then set the "session_event" to "resume" if you are
expecting a reply back from the user or to "close" if the message you are
sending is the last message and the session is to be closed.

The `go-heroku <https://github.com/smn/go-heroku/>`_ application is an
example app that uses the HTTP API to receive and send messages.


Receiving Messages & Events
---------------------------

Vumi Go will forward any inbound messages and events to your application
via HTTP POST. Please specify the URL in the Go UI.

The UI expects you to specify an access token. All requests to the API
require you to use your account key as the username and the token as the
password.

Sending Messages
----------------

::

    PUT http://go.vumi.org/api/v1/go/http_api_nostream/<conversation-key>/messages.json


Publishing Metrics
------------------

You are able to publish metrics to Vumi Go via the HTTP APIs metrics endpoint.
These metrics are able to be displayed in the Vumi GO UI using the dashboards.

How these dashboards are configured is explained in :ref:`dashboards`.

::

    PUT http://go.vumi.org/api/v1/go/http_api_nostream/<conversation-key>/metrics.json

An example using curl from the commandline:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -X PUT \
        --user '<account-key>:<access-token>' \
        --data '[["total_pings", 1200, "MAX"]]' \
        https://go.vumi.org/api/v1/go/http_api_nostream/<conversation-key>/metrics.json \
        -vvv
